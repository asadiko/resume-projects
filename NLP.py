#This code will build a NLP model using TensorFlow. 
# The NLP data is loaded into a list and tokenized using the Tokenizer class from the Keras preprocessing library. 
# The sequences of tokens are then padded to a common length to prepare for modeling. 
# A simple LSTM model is built using the Keras API of TensorFlow and trained on the training data. 
# The performance of the model is not visualized in this example, but could be done by plotting the accuracy and loss curves as in the previous example.
